		<p> I am lucky enough to now have witnessed to championship teams. The Bucks have been contenders now for multiple seasons, and being able to watch them dominate
		in the playoffs in 2021 NBA Finals was awesome. While I wasn't able to attend any games at Fiserv Forum, I was able to visit Deer District multiple times during their
		2021 playoff run.
