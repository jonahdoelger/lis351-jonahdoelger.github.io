			<p> Welcome! This website contains information on the 3 major professional sports teams in Wisconsin: <strong> Green Bay Packers, Milwaukee Bucks, and Milwaukee Brewers. </strong>
			My name is Jonah Doelger, and I am a major sports fan. I have been to games at both Lambeau Field, where the Green Bay Packers Play, and at American Family Field,
			where the Milwaukee Brewers play. Unfortunately, I have not been inside of Fiserv Forum for a game, but I have attended the Milwaukee Buck's Deer District to
			watch playoff basketball. The links below will take you to different pages, where I share my experiences and opinions on each of these teams!
