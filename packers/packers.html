			<dd> I have been a huge Packers fan since I was born. My favorite memory of the Packers was being able to watch them win Super Bowl 45 in 2011. The atosmphere at Lambeau Field is second to none. Your ears will be ringing when you leave the stadium. Everyone in the crowd cheers, and will scream when the Packers make a big play. It doesn't matter where you sit for the game, as the jumbotrons make it easy to see the game from anywhere in the stadium. You are also able to go up an elevator to the highest area of the stadium, which has an amazing view for the game.
